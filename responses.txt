Referee comments:

1. Regarding expressions (41) and similar ones throughout the text: If we are not in the Mott insulating regime, the system is gapless in the thermodynamic limit. Hence, the exponential scaling is a finite size effect for the two lowest values of U that are considered. For values of L \gg 8, I would expect that this exponential law is almost impossible to see numerically. This should be clarified in the text.

2. It would be useful to have an artistic 3d-like figure depicting the two replicas in imaginary time for a 1d system.

3. Throughout the text, the authors write U/t but never \beta t. This should be made consistent

4. In fig 10, the inset shows that the data are compatible with a log behavior. Can any further quantitative information be extracted from it, given the error bars?

5. (i) For the 1d quantum phase transition, the authors should check the literature more carefully for the location of the quantum critical point. (ii) How should the entanglement entropy behave for such a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition? Can a finite size analysis based on the Renyi entropy be applied to determine the quantum critical point more accurately?

6. I would like to know how the error bars are determined, on (i) <SWAP> and (ii) the logarithm of the latter quantity (which is the non-linear operation necessary to compute the entanglement entropy) -- and what is the distribution of these measurements?

7. The output in Appendix A is not comprehensible to me. The readme.md file of the git repo shows the same output, and I did not get much wiser from it. The documentation of the code in the git repo should be improved substantially. Is the code working on 64 bit architectures?

8. I did my best to find a typo: there is a verb missing in the 4th line of the caption of fig 4. The authors deserve praise for writing so precisely.
